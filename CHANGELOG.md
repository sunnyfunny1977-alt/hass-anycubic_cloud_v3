# Changelog

## 1.0.1

### Changed

- `ACE Active Filament` is now created as soon as the printer has an ACE box, instead of waiting for the first filament change. The latch has no value until the box feeds a slot for the first time, so the sensor previously did not exist at all on a fresh install and could not be put on a dashboard. It now exists immediately and reads unavailable until the first change, matching how the other deferred sensors behave.

## 1.0.0

This repository now maintains its own version line. Upstream
`ljschmitt/hass-anycubic_cloud_v3` had independently published a different
0.3.8, so continuing the shared numbering would have produced two releases
with the same tag and different code. Starting at 1.0.0 keeps the two apart;
it is a numbering change, not a rewrite. Functionally this is the previous
0.3.8 of this repository.

### Changed

- Repository links, HACS install instructions, issue tracker and manifest
  metadata now point at this fork. Credit for the upstream fork and the
  original integration is unchanged.

## 0.3.8

### Added

- New `ACE Active Filament` sensor (plus `Secondary ACE Active Filament` for a second box) reporting the filament currently in the toolhead, e.g. `PLA #0047BB`, with material type, sku, colour, slot number and box id as attributes.

### Fixed

- The active ACE slot no longer disappears seconds after a filament change. The printer only reports `loaded_slot` while a change is actually running and returns `-1` once the filament is through, and every cloud poll rebuilt the box from that payload, so the value was visible for roughly 20-30 seconds per tool change and unusable the rest of the time. The last slot the box actually fed is now latched, carried across cloud-poll rebuilds and stored, so it also survives a Home Assistant restart. The raw `loaded_slot` attribute on `ace_spools` is unchanged and still reports the momentary value.

## 0.3.7

### Added

- The `ace_spools` sensor now exposes `loaded_slot`, the ACE slot currently loaded into the toolhead. Until now the ACE data showed which spools are present, but not which one is actually feeding the extruder. The value is zero-based and indexes the existing `spool_info` list directly, so `spool_info[loaded_slot]` is the active spool; `-1` means no filament is loaded. Note that the neighbouring `slot`, `local_slot` and `display_slot` fields remain one-based.

### Fixed

- `create_when_available` entities that already exist in the entity registry are now re-created on startup instead of being skipped until the printer pushes their value again. `Aux Fan Speed %` and `Box Fan Level %` are only set by an MQTT fan message or a print-status `settings` block, never by the regular cloud poll, so restarting Home Assistant mid-print removed them from dashboards for the rest of the job. They now appear as unavailable until the next push arrives. Printers that have never reported the value still get no entity, so the flag keeps doing its original job.

## 0.3.6

### Added

- Added one sensor per ACE filament slot (`ACE Slot 1`-`ACE Slot 4`, plus `Secondary ACE Slot 1`-`4` for a second ACE box). The state combines material type and colour, e.g. `PLA #FF0000`, and reports `empty` for an unloaded slot, so the loaded filament can be placed anywhere in a dashboard instead of only inside the Anycubic card.
- Slot sensors expose `material_type`, `sku`, `color`, `color_hex`, `spool_loaded`, `status`, `slot`, `local_slot`, `box_id` and `source` as attributes.
- The Anycubic filament `sku` is now included in the ACE spool data, including the existing `ace_spools` attributes.

## 0.3.5

### Added

- Added the diagnostic `debug_set_light_status` service to test explicit Anycubic light command types per printer without changing existing light entity IDs.

### Fixed

- Stabilized local and USB file-list loading in the Anycubic panel by keeping the loading state active until the printer returns real file data or the request times out.
- Local and USB file-list service calls now establish the MQTT action connection before requesting printer files, matching the existing button path and avoiding delayed or missing responses when MQTT was not already active.
- The local and USB file-list tabs now handle Home Assistant `file_info: null` states as not loaded instead of rendering a blank content area.
- Fixed the first-open auto-load behavior for local and USB file-list tabs. A failed or too-early auto-load attempt no longer blocks later automatic retries for the rest of the browser session.
- Local and USB file-list tabs now use the selected printer device as their auto-load target, matching their service-based request path.
- Preserved already known ACE boxes when Anycubic sends a single-box `multi_color_box` MQTT update, preventing the secondary ACE Pro from sporadically disappearing in two-ACE setups.

## 0.3.5-beta.3

### Fixed

- Local and USB file-list service calls now establish the MQTT action connection before requesting printer files, matching the existing button path and avoiding delayed or missing responses when MQTT was not already active.
- The local and USB file-list tabs now show explicit loading, empty, and not-loaded messages instead of leaving the content area blank while waiting for a printer response.

## 0.3.5-beta.2

### Fixed

- Fixed the first-open auto-load behavior for local and USB file-list tabs. A failed or too-early auto-load attempt no longer blocks later automatic retries for the rest of the browser session.
- Local and USB file-list tabs now use the selected printer device as their auto-load target, matching their service-based request path.

## 0.3.5-beta.1

### Added

- Added a diagnostic `debug_set_light_status` service to test explicit Anycubic light command types per printer without changing the existing light entity IDs.

## 0.3.4

### Fixed

- Preserved already known ACE boxes when Anycubic sends a single-box `multi_color_box` MQTT update, preventing the secondary ACE Pro from sporadically disappearing in two-ACE setups.

## 0.3.3

### Fixed

- Mapped Anycubic print status code `9` to `leveling` so bed leveling no longer appears as `unknown` while the printer is busy.
- Fixed dashboard-card ETA formatting to use the browser/Home Assistant local time instead of UTC.

## 0.3.2

### Fixed

- Added explicit `dark_icon.png` and `dark_logo.png` brand assets so Home Assistant 2026.3+ can resolve both light and dark brand image variants from the local custom integration package.

### Notes

- Older Home Assistant versions and current HACS download lists may still use the public brands CDN and can show a generic placeholder there. The local brand assets are only available through Home Assistant's local brands proxy.

## 0.3.1

### Fixed

- Suggested the compatibility entity ID suffix `job_z_thickness` for the existing internal `job_z_thick` layer-height sensor key.
- Added the missing local brand logo file next to the existing local brand icon for Home Assistant 2026.3 and newer.
- Rebuilt the bundled dashboard card so its visible console version matches the integration release.

### Notes

- Existing installations can use the `anycubic_ha_integration.migrate_entity_ids` service to rename an existing `job_z_thick` entity to the compatible `job_z_thickness` entity ID after testing with `dry_run: true`.
- HACS can only offer updates automatically when the integration was installed as a HACS custom repository. Manual installations still need manual replacement.
- HACS may still show a generic placeholder icon in its downloads list until HACS itself switches that view to Home Assistant's local brands proxy for custom integrations.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- Added the native Home Assistant `light.*` entity for Anycubic camera light control.
- Added the side view camera panel with manual stream start, zoom, fullscreen, and optional per-printer Home Assistant `camera.*` mappings.
- Added cautious first-open auto-loading for local, USB, and cloud file-list tabs.
- Added local and USB file print preparation from the panel, with printer selection and optional ACE slot mapping.
- Added stable English entity-ID suggestions plus the `migrate_entity_ids` service for older localized entity IDs.
- Added release safety checks for synchronized versions, private-data patterns, and tag/release collisions.

### Changed

- Kobra X camera light now uses initial command type `3`, matching the value confirmed through Slicer/MQTT behavior. This fixes the Home Assistant restart case where the light command failed until the Slicer toggled the light once.
- Kobra X ACE/material handling now treats ACE-reserved internal rack slots as ACE feed entries instead of normal filament slots.
- ACE/material spool layout keeps dynamic slot data while rendering up to four evenly sized spool items per row.
- The built-in panel and dashboard-card entity lookups now expect stable English technical entity IDs instead of localized German fallback IDs.
- Local and USB file views clear stale folder data immediately during folder changes.
- Camera streams in the side view start only when Play is pressed and stop on Stop, printer change, or leaving the view.

### Fixed

- Reduced known Kobra X MQTT warning noise for progress reports without temperature fields, `aux_fan_speed_pct`, `z_comp`, `video/initSuccess`, and known `buried` reports.
- Handled `list_mode` in local and USB file-list MQTT reports.
- Fixed the file-list path coordinator crash from the withdrawn `0.1.9` release.
- Fixed sensor setup issues from `0.1.6`.
- Prevented offline printers from also appearing as available or busy.

### Notes

- MQTT-dependent data can take a short time to initialize after a Home Assistant restart. During that window, MQTT/peripheral states may temporarily appear inactive or unknown.
- Kobra S1 basic functions are reported, while camera and chamber light support remain open for further feedback.
