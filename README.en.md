[![Open in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=sunnyfunny1977-alt&repository=hass-anycubic_cloud_v3&category=integration)

A Home Assistant integration for Anycubic cloud printers with status sensors, MQTT real-time updates, print and file actions, ACE/material management, and an optional camera view.

The integration is installed through HACS as a custom repository.

> **Independent fork line.** From **1.0.0** this repository uses its own version numbering, deliberately decoupled from the upstream fork so releases and tags cannot collide. Same-numbered releases in [ljschmitt/hass-anycubic_cloud_v3](https://github.com/ljschmitt/hass-anycubic_cloud_v3) are **not** the same code.

## Highlights

- Multiple Anycubic printers in one Home Assistant installation
- Cloud polling and optional MQTT real-time updates
- Print status, temperatures, speed, fan, layers, progress, and timing sensors
- Pause, resume, cancel, and prepared print workflows
- Local, USB, and cloud file views
- ACE spool, material, color, and drying information
- `ACE Active Filament` sensor showing the filament currently in the toolhead, held between tool changes and across restarts
- One sensor per ACE slot (`ACE Slot 1`–`4`, plus `Secondary ACE Slot 1`–`4` with a second box) reporting material type and color as its state, e.g. `PLA #FF0000`, usable anywhere in a dashboard
- `loaded_slot` attribute on the ACE spools sensor, identifying which slot is currently loaded into the toolhead
- Native camera-light entity on supported printers
- On-demand Anycubic cloud camera stream
- Optional per-printer Home Assistant `camera.*` mapping for local or alternative firmware cameras
- Dedicated Anycubic Cloud panel plus an optional matching dashboard card

## Compatibility

Reported or tested:

- Anycubic Kobra 3 Combo
- Anycubic Kobra X, including known ACE/material setups and camera light
- Anycubic Kobra S1 basic functions; camera and chamber light still need further testing
- Anycubic Kobra 2, Kobra 2 Max, and Kobra 2 Pro
- Anycubic Photon Mono M5s basic support
- Anycubic M7 Pro basic support

Feedback about additional models is welcome. Never include tokens, private IP addresses, serial numbers, printer IDs, or other personal data in public issues.

## Installation with HACS

Until the default HACS catalog submission is merged:

1. Open **HACS -> Integrations -> menu -> Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/sunnyfunny1977-alt/hass-anycubic_cloud_v3` as an **Integration**.
3. Search for **Anycubic HA Integration** and install it.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Open **Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration**.

For MQTT support, select the **Slicer Next (Windows)** authentication method and provide its access token. The alternative web token method supports cloud polling but not MQTT.

Detailed token extraction, camera setup, Rinkhals/Moonraker mapping, entity migration, and troubleshooting instructions are available in the [German documentation](README.md).

## Dashboard card

The recommended companion dashboard card is [ljschmitt/hass-anycubic_card](https://github.com/ljschmitt/hass-anycubic_card). The integration also includes its own Home Assistant side panel, so the external card is optional.

## Camera behavior

The cloud camera stream is started only after the user presses Play. It is stopped when leaving the view, changing printers, or stopping playback. This prevents background camera sessions.

Alternative firmware cameras can be mapped per printer to an existing Home Assistant `camera.*` entity. Printers without a mapping continue to use the Anycubic cloud camera.

## Security and privacy

This integration communicates with Anycubic cloud services and can control supported printer actions. Use it at your own risk and test control functions carefully.

Do not publish Anycubic tokens, Home Assistant credentials, printer IDs, serial numbers, MAC addresses, private URLs, local IP addresses, diagnostics containing personal data, or environment-specific camera mappings.
